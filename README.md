# TcpServer

TcpServer is a java library for simplifying the creation of Tcp-Servers.
The library was originally created for our <a href="./../StreamCore">StreamCore</a> project.

## Installation

To add the library to your project, you first need to add our repository server.
```xml
<repository>
    <id>meldlabs</id>
    <name>maven-releases</name>
    <url>https://nx.meldlabs.xyz/repository/maven-releases/</url>
</repository>
```

Then you can import the library as dependency.
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>xyz.meldlabs</groupId>
    <artifactId>tcpserver</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
